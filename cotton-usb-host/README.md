# cotton-usb-host

Part of the [Cotton](https://github.com/pdh11/cotton) project.

## A no-std, no-alloc USB host stack for embedded devices

This crate enables the USB host-controller peripheral on the RP2040
and RP2350 microcontrollers, allowing USB devices (memory sticks,
keyboards, hubs, etc.) to be connected directly to the RP2040/2350 and
controlled by it.

USB operation is _asynchronous_ and so this crate is suited for use
with embedded asynchronous executors such as
[RTIC&nbsp;2](https://rtic.rs/2/book/en/) and
[Embassy](https://embassy.dev).

Includes:

 - control, interrupt, and bulk endpoint support;
 - hub support;
 - hot-plug, and hot-unplug, including of hubs.

Currently supports:

 - RP2040 (USB 1.1 host)[^1]
 - RP235x (USB 1.1 host)[^1]

System-tests and examples:

 - [rp2040-usb-hid-boot-keyboard](https://github.com/pdh11/cotton/blob/main/cross/rp2040-w5500-rtic2/src/bin/rp2040-usb-hid-boot-keyboard.rs): identifying
   and driving USB keyboards ("Human Interface Devices", HID);
 - [rp2040-usb-msc](https://github.com/pdh11/cotton/blob/main/cross/rp2040-w5500-rtic2/src/bin/rp2040-usb-msc.rs):
   RP2040 identifying and driving mass-storage class devices (e.g., USB flash
   drives); **WARNING** this _writes_ to the USB drive, don't use one with
   data on that you want to keep;
 - [rp2040-usb-otge100](https://github.com/pdh11/cotton/blob/main/cross/rp2040-w5500-rtic2/src/bin/rp2040-usb-otge100.rs):
   identifying (not yet really "driving") a Plugable USB2-OTGE100
   Ethernet adaptor (based on ASIX AX88772).
 - [rp2040-usb-msc](https://github.com/pdh11/cotton/blob/main/cross/rp2040-w5500-rtic2/src/bin/rp2040-usb-msc.rs):
   RP2350 identifying and driving mass-storage class devices (e.g., USB flash
   drives); **WARNING** this _writes_ to the USB drive, don't use one with
   data on that you want to keep;

Limitations:

 - maximum of 31 devices total (including hubs);
 - maximum of 15 hubs;
 - maximum of 15 ports on any one hub[^2];
 - maximum of 256 bytes of configuration descriptors;
 - isochronous endpoints not yet implemented;
 - supports Low Speed (1.5Mbits/s) and Full Speed (12Mbits/s)
   operation only -- not High Speed (480Mbits/s) or above.

[^1]: The documentation describes this as "USB&nbsp;2.0 LS and FS" (1.5 and
12Mbits/s), but as the _only_ changes in USB&nbsp;2.0 compared to 1.1
were related to the addition of HS (480Mbits/s), it seems more honest
to describe it as USB&nbsp;1.1.

[^2]: USB&nbsp;3.0 explicitly limits hubs to 15 downstream ports;
USB&nbsp;2.0 and earlier did not, but even for USB&nbsp;2.0 such wide
hubs are either very rare or, quite possibly, non-existent. Most
freestanding hubs which _appear_ to have more than about 7 downstream
ports, are in fact multiple hubs in a trenchcoat.

Library documentation is [on
docs.rs](https://docs.rs/cotton-usb-host/latest/cotton_usb_host/).

## Using cotton-usb-host with a Raspberry&nbsp;Pi Pico

This crate configures the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi Pico's USB peripheral for
USB host mode _only_, and not USB device mode. So before running your
code, make sure that the USB connector on your Raspberry&nbsp;Pi Pico
is plugged into a USB device, and not into another USB host such as a
laptop[^3]. (You can still use a SWD connection via the 3-pin debug
connector to program and debug your Raspberry&nbsp;Pi Pico -- just not
the USB connection.)

If your Raspberry&nbsp;Pi Pico is itself powered by USB (perhaps via a
Pico Debug Probe), then it will not have enough power to reliably
supply USB power to downstream devices unless you power your Pico's
VUSB/GND pins from a separate 5V power supply &mdash; and perhaps not
even then. For best results with multiple devices, you should use a
_powered_ hub. (Powered hubs with micro-USB plugs, compatible with the
Raspberry&nbsp;Pi Pico in host mode, are often sold as "[OTG
hubs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AuviPal-Adapter-Playstation-Classic-Raspberry-Black/dp/B083WML1XB/)".)

The crate is split between a generic (hardware-agnostic) `usb_bus::UsbBus`
class, and a host-controller driver specific to the RP2040. So the
minimal code example would involve:

 - creating a `UsbShared` object, making sure it's shared between the
   software tasks and the hardware interrupt handler;
 - arranging that the `USBCTRL_IRQ` interrupt handler calls `UsbShared::on_irq()`;
 - creating a `UsbStatics` object, which needn't be shared, but must
   be `&'static` &mdash; for instance, by using the `static-cell` crate;
 - constructing a `host::rp2040::Rp2040HostController` from the UsbShared,
   the UsbStatics, and the USB register banks from `rp2040-pac`;
 - constructing a `UsbBus` from the host-controller driver;
 - obtaining a stream of device-status events from
   `UsbBus::device_events()` &mdash; or, alternatively,
   `UsbBus::device_events_no_hubs()` for smaller code-size if
   supporting USB hubs isn't required;
 - waiting on the stream until it produces a `DeviceEvent::Connect`
   indicating that the device has been detected;
 - using APIs such as `UsbBus::control_transfer` to read descriptors,
   `UsbBus::configure` to configure the device appropriately, and
   `UsbBus::interrupt_endpoint` to read data from the device.

A complete example for RP2040 is at
   <https://github.com/pdh11/cotton/blob/main/cross/rp2040-w5500-rtic2/src/bin/rp2040-usb-msc.rs>;
   **WARNING** this _writes_ to the USB drive, don't use one with data
   on that you want to keep.

[^3]: The Raspberry&nbsp;Pi Pico (and the W5500-EVB-Pico for that
matter) have USB Micro-B receptacles (sockets), capable of receiving
Micro-B plugs only. Because they are capable of both USB device and
USB host, they _should_ arguably have had USB Micro-AB receptacles,
capable of receiving both Micro-A (rectangular) and Micro-B
(trapezium) plugs. But USB cables and adaptors with Micro-B plugs for
their _host_ side connection (instead of Micro-A which it [should
technically be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go)) are
common. Both ST and Renesas devboards get this right: they have Micro-AB
receptacles (though the very newest ST ones have type-C instead).

## Writing drivers for USB devices

This crate includes an example of identifying and communicating with
a Plugable USB2-OTGE100 Ethernet adaptor based on the ASIX&nbsp;AX88772
chip. A more complete example driver, for USB mass-storage class devices,
is in the cotton-usb-host-msc crate.

Once your code has successfully created the `UsbBus` object and has
called `UsbBus::device_events()`, it will receive `DeviceInfo` objects
which allow your code to identify relevant devices either by class
code (for generic class drivers such as mass-storage or HID) or by VID
and PID (for device-specific drivers).

The cotton-usb-host-msc crate includes example usage of bulk endpoints;
the cotton-usb-host-hid crate uses an interrupt endpoint. (Isochronous
endpoints are not currently supported.)

## Writing drivers for alternative host controllers

The `UsbBus` code _should_ be generic enough to be usable with other
microcontrollers' USB host peripherals. You'll need to implement the
`host_controller::HostController` trait, which encapsulates all the
actual hardware interaction. Typically such host controllers have a
smallish, fixed number of "pipes" (actively-used endpoints) which can
be used simultaneously; you might find `async_pool::Pool`, as used by
the RP2040 host-controller driver, to be a convenient way of
allocating those pipes as required.

The RP2040 support is in this repo to provide a convenient worked example;
specific host-controller support for other microcontrollers probably
belongs in those microcontrollers' HAL crates.
